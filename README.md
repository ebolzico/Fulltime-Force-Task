# Instructions to run the app:
    First of all, once the repository was cloned, place yourself in the folder 'api'.
    Once there, you will execute the command 'npm install' and let the computer do it's job.
    When it finishes, you will place yourself in the 'client' folder and execute the same command.

    When you've done with the previous instructions, you will place yourself in th general folder
    and execute 'npm start'. This will start the app.

# Usage:
    At the beginning, you will notice the blank screen, once you read the title, you will know
    how to proceed.


# Tips of interest:
    You will notice in the code that I made it quite simple and light. If well, I am aware that
    this test was to see my handling with different technologies, I opted for the quality of code. 
    Given the simple task it had to do, I found the component-recycling tool that characterizes
    React very suitable for it. This is why there is only one component and no Redux, to not oversize
    the project without cause. I hope you like it! 


Best regards.
