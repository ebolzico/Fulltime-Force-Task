    First of all, once the repository was cloned, place yourself in the folder 'api'.
    Once there, you will execute the command 'npm install' and let the computer do it's job.
    When it finishes, you will place yourself in the 'client' folder and execute the same command.

## Tips of interest:
    You will notice in the code that I made it quite simple and light. If well, I am aware that
    this test was to see my handling with different technologies, I opted for the quality of code. 
    Given the simple task it had to do, I found the component-recycling tool that characterizes
    React very suitable for it. This is why there is only one component and no Redux, to not oversize
    the project without cause. I hope you like it! 


Best regards.
